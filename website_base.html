            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">nu James, HOD, Department of Science/Mathematics & Chief Examination Officer, JBCN International School, Borivali, Mumbai, explains the need and benefits of using innovations in mathematics teaching. Innovative practices undertaken by JBCN International School, Borivali, such as First in Math, are discussed.
            The teaching and learning of mathematics is a complex activity and many factors determine its success. The nature and quality of instructional material, the presentation of content, the pedagogic skills of the teacher, the learning environment and the motivation of students are all important and must be kept in mind in any effort to ensure quality in the teaching-learning of mathematics. The value of using innovation, especially the use of manipulatives, has been recognized for many years, but some teachers are reluctant to incorporate it in their lessons. It is important for children to have a variety of materials to manipulate and explore if they are to construct mathematical knowledge. In order to have opportunities to learn math, children need first hand experiences related to math, interaction with other children and adults concerning these experiences and time to reflect on the experiences. Educational research indicates that the most valuable learning occurs when students actively construct their own mathematical understanding, which is often accomplished through the use of manipulatives.

JBCN International School believes in the maxim of learning through fun. The school is in association with various programmes/ organizations who practice this thoroughly in their activities.

Through the First In Math (FIM) Online Program, learners get immersed in an interactive environment where new skills are acquired progressively and improvement is continually recognized. In sports, kids take ownership of the practice necessary to improve, often with little guidance from adults. First In Math (FIM) facilitates this same response where students are eager to practice mathematics.
